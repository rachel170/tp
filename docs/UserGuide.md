## Introduction
Welcome to the FlashNotes User Guide.

FlashNotes is a **desktop app for text-based flashcards**, built for students who wish to utilise English flashcards for studying. FlashNotes is also optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FlashNotes will be faster than traditional GUI apps.

Flashcards are one of the oldest forms of studying methods, but it is also remarkably difficult to keep track of the vast amount of content to study for. However, with FlashNotes, you can now keep track of your flashcards and their content with ease.
FlashNotes allows you to organise your flashcards by topics or subjects using Decks. 

FlashNotes utilises a studying technique known as [Active Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall), allowing you to test yourself using flashcards to check if you have mastered your content.
Furthermore, FlashNotes will also keep track of your progress and show you an overview of how well you have mastered your content using flashcards.

This User Guide is for user who have no prior knowledge on how to create and review flashcards using FlashNotes. We will teach you how create and manage your flashcards more efficiently, and how to review your flashcards for studying using FlashNotes. 
We will provide you with all the various features and commands of FlashNotes, and its details. 

To get started, head over to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

To see the summary of all our commands, go to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) section.

Here's the Table of Contents for a brief overview of our User Guide, or for you to quickly access other sections of our User Guide.

:warning: Things to note:

* Flashcard can only be marked as wrong after the card has been flipped to show the answer.
* Even if the user has flipped to view the answer, and flips back to view the question, the user has to 
flip back to the answer again before they can mark the flashcard as wrong.
* Flipping the flashcard even number of times will result in the question to be shown, and hence the flashcard cannot
 be marked in this case.

### About Review Statistics

At the end of a review session, FlashNotes will calculate your score for the session and display in a format similar to the image shown below. <br>

![Review Window with Review Statistics](images/UG_ReviewStatistics.png)

As shown in the above image, the Review Window will display the following information:
 * The **total number of questions** you undertook in the review session.
 * The **number of questions marked as correct during your first attempt** at the question.
 * The calculated **percentage of questions answered correctly on your first attempt**, a numeric value between 0 and 100, rounded to 1 decimal place.

Of the three types of information, only the calculated percentage will be saved by FlashNotes. This is so that you can track your revision progress for any deck that you conduct a review session in.

To view the statistics of your last review session for any deck, simply navigate back to the **Main Mode** and look under the Deck's name as indicated in the image below.

![Review Statistics In Main Mode](images/UG_ReviewStatisticsInHome.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: Things to note:

* FlashNotes will calculate and save your review statistics only if you have marked all the questions in the review session as correct. Exiting or ending the review session early will not generate or save the result statistics of the incomplete review session.
* Regarding the review statistics of any review session started after the usage of the `listAll` command in **Main Mode** (or in other words: any review sessions started with all the cards in FlashNotes), the review statistics for such review sessions will still be generated and displayed, but it will not be saved by FlashNotes.
